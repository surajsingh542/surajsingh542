- 👋 Hi, I’m @surajsingh542
- 👀 I’m interested in Coding and Building/Creating New Stuff.
But as you can see that I have just started working on myself.
And hence currently instead of creating new stuff or developing something, most of the 
time I am just messed up and confused on where to start or stuck on how to code a certain problem. 
But there is this one thing that I can assure you all is that, either I am going to mess up the code 
or code it perfectly; I am not going to stop and will always learn something new out of whatever I do.
- 🌱 I’m currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science & Engineering (B.Tech in CSE).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on App/Web Development, Full Stack Projects.
- 📫 Just reach me out on LinkedIn for anything....
